            "description": "Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners craving a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability-all in one layer-was refined. The result is a featherweight, formfitting and virtually seamless upper."

That’s why the development team for the Nike LunarEpic Low Flyknit 2 started with feedback from one group of runners in particular: women. But the team didn’t want to just start there. They wanted to develop around women at every step of the process — with the belief that it would lead to a better running shoe, not just for women, but for all runners. Flipping the process enabled the team to gain new insights and refine details of the shoe that otherwise would have gone unnoticed."
